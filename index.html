                Thank you for visiting my project! I want to apologize for not being able to create a fully developed prototype. 
                Due to time constraints from my semester exams and other academic commitments, I utilized Canva to put together this initial version. 
                There are additional pages and features that I intended to include, but unfortunately, I couldn't complete them. 
                I appreciate your understanding and support!
            </p>
